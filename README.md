# Application Description  
People often feel intimidated by plant care due to forgetfulness, whether that be about when they last watered the plants or how often they should be watering. My iOS application was built with these considerations in mind, as it allows users to create a profile for each of their plants and receive calendar reminders for their plants' needs. 

Plantered is also great for those with plant sitters! Information such as its species name, watering frequency,  location in the home, and even an image of it, can be logged to ensure the person taking care of your plants doesn't get confused.
